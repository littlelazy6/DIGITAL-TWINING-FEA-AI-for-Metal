# FEA-DeepLearning-for-Metal-Materials-
This project aims to utilize a large database of input-output samples initiated from Finite element analysis (FEA) modelling to develop a deep learning tool. With this tool, instant estimation of the output (currently yield stress, force-displacement curves) can be obtained, associated with a given input (currently phase and crystallographical features) of multi-phase stainless steels.

Further development includes accuracy improvement on FEA and Deep learning models and extension to more commonly used alloys (Titanium, Aluminium, Copper, etc) in the manufacturing industry.

This project acknowledges support from JetBrains, and uses PyCharm and TensorFlow for Deep Learning training and relative tool development.
