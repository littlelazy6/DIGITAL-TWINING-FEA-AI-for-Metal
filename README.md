# FEA-DeepLearning-for-Metal-Materials-
This project aims at utilizing a large database of input-output samples initiated from Finite element analysis (FEA) modelling to develop a deep learning tool. With this tool, instant estimatation of the output (currenly yield stress, force-displacement curves) can be obtained, associated with a given input (currently phase and crystallographical features) of multi-phase stainless steels.

Further development include accuracy improvement on both FEA and Deep learning models, as well as extention to more commonly-used alloys (Titanium, Aluminium, Copper, etc) in the manufacturing industry.
